This guide gathers best practices for Cocoa library authors. The goal is to make integration of libraries easier for everyone, using CocoaPods or not. Ultimately, [CocoaPods will leverage](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/1024) existing Xcode projects to build libraries, so this will require some rigor from library authors.

## What should be the structure of a library project?

* Xcode workspace
	* Library project
		* Source Code
		* Headers (public/project/private, Copy Files vs Copy Headers)
		* Resources
		* Frameworks (indicative)
		* `DYLIB_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` (semver)
	* App project
		* `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` + `#import <Lib/Lib.h>`

* Separate Demo app project
* Implicit Dependencies
* Multiple (dependent) libraries
* License
* Difference between `#import` in source files and header files
